#Data Analytics Life Cycle

## 1. Data Discovery
First up is Data Discovery, where you identify what ingredients (data) you have and what you might need. Just like checking your pantry before starting a recipe.
## 2. Data Preparation
Then comes Data Preparation, where you clean, organize, and format the data. It's like washing, chopping, and measuring ingredients before cooking.
## 3. Model Planning
Next is Model Planning, where you decide on the recipe (algorithm) you'll use to analyze the data. This is akin to choosing a baking method and a recipe.
## 4. Model Building
After that is Model Building, where you actually create and test your model. It's similar to mixing ingredients, putting the cake in the oven, and checking on it while it bakes.
## 5. Communicate Results
Once your cake (or model) is ready, it's time to Communicate Results. You present your findings to others, like serving your cake to guests.
## 6. Operationalize
Finally, there's Operationalize, where you integrate your model into regular operations. It's like making the cake a regular part of your dessert menu.
